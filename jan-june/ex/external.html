            <div class="conn">
            <p>Poetry has been around for almost four thousand years. Like other forms of literature, poetry is written to share ideas, express emotions, and create imagery. Poets choose words for their meaning and acoustics, arranging them to create a tempo known as the meter. Some poems incorporate rhyme schemes, with two or more lines that end in like-sounding words.

                Today, poetry remains an important part of art and culture. Every year, the United States Library of Congress appoints a Poet Laureate to represent the art of poetry in America. From Shakespearean sonnets to Maya Angelou’s reflective compositions, poems are long-lived, read and recited for generations.
                Poetry is defined as a type of literature or artistic writing that tries to appeal to the reader’s emotions and imagination through a variety of different poetic techniques.

The poet uses a combination of rhythm, word choice, sounds, rhymes, structure and more to create a piece of writing that stirs the reader’s feelings.

Poems come in lots of different forms and styles and the text is often separated into paragraphs which are called stanzas.

A poem is usually about, or alluding to, a specific topic or theme. Some of the most common themes that poets write about are:

love;
nature;
friendship;
family;
animals;
good vs evil;
growing up and ageing;
bravery and courage;
prejudice;
war.
